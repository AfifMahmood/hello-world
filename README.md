Following tutorial in using GitHub

Hey, so this is my first try in using GitHub. 
The first task in using GItHub was to create a repository and then new branch. New branch copies the current "master" branch so that we can implement a change in the copied version before implementing it in the master branch. The purpose of this is to avoid damage to the master branch while developing new features.
